    <h2>Elite Dangerous</h2>
    
    <p>Elite Dangerous is a game that was released on December 16th, 2014.<br/>
    It was developed and published by Frontier Developments and is one of my favorite<br/>
        games of that year. </p>
    
    <p>The goal of the game is to become a successful freelance pilot in the Pilot's Federation, <br/>
        you can do a lot to make money, from slave trading to bounty hunting, there is plenty to do,<br/>
        in this game. There is also a focus on exploration, you can go out from the inhabited area of the Milky <br/>
        Way galaxy and explore nebulas, find black holes, and some have even found alien life-forms.</p>
    <br/>
    
    <p>By the end of April 2015 Elite Dangerous had sold more than 500,000 copies.</p>
